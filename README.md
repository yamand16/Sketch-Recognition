# Real Time Sketch Recognition System

**Summary**

This repository is my project for Artificial Intelligence course. In this project, AlexNet deep CNN model [1] has been utilized to classify sketch objects. TU Berlin sketch dataset [2] has been used in order to train classifier model. 

**Prerequisites:**
- TensorFlow 1.7 or later
- Python 3
- Tkinter

My code is tested with Titan X GPUs.

The pretrained AlexNet model can be downloaded here:
